<b> Heart Disease Detection </b>

This project focused on the analysis of  multivariate type of dataset for heart disease prediction. The project analyses the previous Cleveland dataset of 'UCI Heart disease dataset' obtained from UCI ML repository The dataset consists of 303 entries and 14 attributes which are age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels, Thalassemia and target attribute indicating presence or absence of heart disease. No missing values were found in the dataset as each column has 303 non-null entries.

This project demonstrates the relationship between various health predictors for patients such as age, blood pressure, heart rate, exercise induced angina, presence or absence of heart disease and so on. The major goal was to build a predictive to identify individuals with heart disease accurately. The tasks of the project included-

1. Exploratory data analysis for numerical and categorical features
2. Checking for misisng values
3. Finding correlation between variables
4. Developing predictive model using 9 classifiers to detect individuals with heart disease
5. Assess performance of classifiers based on Accuracy, ROC score, Recall, F1-score and Precision
